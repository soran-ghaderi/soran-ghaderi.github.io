   I am a Master's student pursuing a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/">University of Essex</a>, Under the supervision of
   <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/CITIL35902/Luca-Citi">Professor Luca Citi</a>. Previously, I obtained my
   bachelor's degree from the <a href="https://eng.uok.ac.ir/en/">University of Kurdistan</a>. I have experience in
   developing deep learning pipelines through contributions to the open-source community and research collaborations.
   
   My ultimate objective is to study the cognitive mechanisms underlying intelligence and develop agents able to
   reason and interact with the real world.
   
   A major challenge in current AI models is their struggle with consistent logical reasoning and decision-making,
   especially in scenarios that require multi-step inference or handling of previously unseen situations. Current LLMs can
   generate highly semantically coherent text, yet, often fail in robust reasoning abilities that are necessary for tasks
   such as complex problem-solving, planning, or adapting to novel environments.
   
   To this end, my research explores fully <strong>differentiable approaches for implementing multi-step reasoning</strong> in LLMs,
   decision-making, zero-shot learning within uncertain environments, and embodied agents.
   This involves developing new architectures that can maintain coherent thought processes across multiple inference steps.<br>
   
   In a wider context, I am fascinated by the idea of developing a network of specialized networks such as memory and rapid learning,
   goal-driven planning, spatial reasoning, and error detection and conflict monitoring that operate collaboratively to 
   consistently make good decisions within a complex environment. I am interested in transformers and attention
   mechanisms with a bias toward efficient computation in these settings: generative models, multimodal
   learning, and self-supervised learning.
#      I am a Master's student pursuing a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Essex.
#    With over three years of hands-on experience, my passion lies in the realm of deep learning and autonomous agents.
#
#    I am eager to explore the potential of attention mechanisms in enhancing the performance of multimodal models in
#    representation learning, reasoning, and zero-shot learning within uncertain environments.
#
#    Parallel to this, I have actively engaged in freelance work and collaborated with research teams, and have made
#    contributions to the open-source community.


#  ### Academic accomplishments<br>
#
#
#
#
#   - <a href="https://github.com/soran-ghaderi/NUSCCF">"<b>A new efficient subspace and K-Means-clustering based method to
#  improve Collaborative Filtering</b>"</a> was my B.Eng. final thesis, that tries to deal with the <b>High dimensionality</b> and
#  <b>data sparsity</b> problems in an <b>efficient</b> way which recommender systems are facing. <br>
#
#   - Another evident research accomplishment was in bioinformatics, that aimed to <b>predict</b> new correlations between
#  probiotics and diseases, which resulted in finding several new potential connections between the two.<br>
#
#   - Furthermore, I've written a new <b>Python library</b> for researchers working on <b>link prediction</b> in
#  <b>bipartite graphs</b> named <a href="https://github.com/bi-graph/bigraph"><b>BiGraph</b></a>. Fortunately, the repository on
#  Github has new contributors and is being updated once in a while. There's also the
#  <a href="https://bigraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html"><b>documentation</b></a> available for the package.
#  <br>
#
#  - Emgraph is a Python library — that I have worked on as a <b>ML engineer</b> — that tries to bring researchers involved in
#  <b>graph representation learning</b> up to speed.

  I'm Soran Ghaderi holding a BEng. in computer software engineering since 2018. My academic passions encompass the
  cutting-edge research conducted in the fields of machine learning; particularly, methods that are
  trying to understand and represent the surrounding world optimally.<br>

  During my B.Eng., recommendation systems, and bioinformatics were what I was interested in, along which I engrossed in
  machine learning and deep learning fields. Those were the impetuses to delve more deeply into the theories.
  Following the outstanding papers and research published by the internationally renowned research-labs and
  tech-companies for the last few years, on the one hand, I have acquired a general idea of the current challenges scientists
  are facing. On the other hand, having an avid interest in coding and hands-on stuff, I've got an up-to-date knowledge of
  current technologies used in the field of machine learning, including a couple of frameworks and libraries as
  well as some of the well-known optimization and high-performance computing techniques.<br>
  <br>
#  ### Technical skills<br>
#
#  Will be uploaded soon<br>
#
#  I'm a bit pressed for time at the moment, however, I will upload more information later on. If you think you'll come
#  here once in a blue moon and I can help you out in someway, then you can drop me an email or check out my
#  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/soran-ghaderi/">Linkedin</a>.

#  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

#  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
