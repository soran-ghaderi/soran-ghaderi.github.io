  Looking for a well-suited deep learning research position, I am currently intending to both join a vibrant research team and build on my academic foundations in Deep learning both theoretically and practically and stay in tune with new innovative researches through continued coursework and professional development.

  Furthermore, I have done a few pieces of research in Bioinformatic and Recommender systems as well as having team-working experience in software companies.

  Write an awesome description about yourself here, this supports markdown, so you can add [links](http://foobar.com) and highlight things <mark>Deep learning</mark>.

  My overall goal is to use brain mechanisms to enhance current techniques in the machine learning. However, I do have more specific intersts in the field, and the following are some of them:
#  You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else markdown supports such as
#    - Lists
#    - Tables
#    - <a href="google.com">Links</a>
#    - Images

# More Section

  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
