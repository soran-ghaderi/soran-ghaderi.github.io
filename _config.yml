    <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
  I received my MSc in Artificial Intelligence at the <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/">University of Essex</a>, supervised by
  <a href="https://www.essex.ac.uk/people/CITIL35902/Luca-Citi">Professor Luca Citi</a>. Previously, I obtained my
  bachelor's degree from the <a href="https://eng.uok.ac.ir/en/">University of Kurdistan</a>. During my postgraduate studies,
  I was working on reasoning in LLMs for code generation; as a result, I developed a new approach for guiding the 
  generation process. It consisted of a separate deep-think stage with self-reflection (somehow similar to OpenAI o1) and 
  a direct integration of thoughts (hidden states) into the LLM's main generation's hidden states using model surgery! 
  This framework called <a href="https://soran-ghaderi.github.io/nir/">NIR</a> is applicable to various LLMs without 
  finetuning. As an extension, It has a thought memory manager which controls the memories and thoughts of the LLM 
  (not included in the evaluations) which allows the integration of approaches like Neural Turing Machines or DNC and LLMs.
  
  I have also contributed to the open-source projects and have collaborated with research teams in the past.</p>

    <h2>Research Interests</h2>
  
    <p>
    My ultimate objective is to study the cognitive mechanisms underlying intelligence and develop embodied agents able to
    reason and interact with the real world.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    A major challenge in current AI models is their struggle with consistent logical reasoning and decision-making,
    especially in scenarios that require multi-step inference or handling of previously unseen situations. Current models (ie. LLMs) can
    generate highly semantically coherent text, yet, often fail in robust reasoning abilities that are necessary for tasks
    such as complex problem-solving, planning, or adapting to novel environments.
    </p>
    
    <p>
    Researchers have explored many approaches such as Prompt engineering methods (eg. CoT and self-reflection), which 
    can enhance reasoning abilities to an extent as a temporarily and short-term solution, however, they are limited 
    and are not architecturally native to the models. 
    Therefore, my research focuses on developing <strong>differentiable approaches for implementing iterative reasoning</strong> and
    decision-making in uncertain environments in embodied agents.
    This involves developing new architectures that can maintain coherent thought processes across multiple inference steps.<br>
    </p>
    
    <p>Currently, I am exploring diffusion models, score-based and flow-based models, differential geometry 
    (particularly Riemannian geometry), metric learning, energy-based models, joint embedding predictive architectures 
    operating in the latent spaces among others to design generalizable intelligent agents capable of reasoning 
    (as an optimization problem), deliberate planning (system 2-like), and able to handle uncertainty (in the inference-time)</p>
    
    <p>
    In a wider context, I am fascinated by the idea of developing a network of specialized networks such as memory and rapid learning,
    goal-driven planning, spatial reasoning, and error detection and conflict monitoring that operate collaboratively to 
    consistently make good decisions within a complex environment. I am interested in transformers and attention
    mechanisms with a bias toward efficient computation in these settings: generative models, multimodal
    learning, and self-supervised learning.

#        I am a Master's student pursuing a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Essex.
#      With over three years of hands-on experience, my passion lies in the realm of deep learning and autonomous agents.
#
#      I am eager to explore the potential of attention mechanisms in enhancing the performance of multimodal models in
#      representation learning, reasoning, and zero-shot learning within uncertain environments.
#
#      Parallel to this, I have actively engaged in freelance work and collaborated with research teams, and have made
#      contributions to the open-source community.

  I'm Soran Ghaderi holding a BEng. in computer software engineering since 2018. My academic passions encompass the
  cutting-edge research conducted in the fields of machine learning; particularly, methods that are
  trying to understand and represent the surrounding world optimally.<br>

  During my B.Eng., recommendation systems, and bioinformatics were what I was interested in, along which I engrossed in
  machine learning and deep learning fields. Those were the impetuses to delve more deeply into the theories.
  Following the outstanding papers and research published by the internationally renowned research-labs and
  tech-companies for the last few years, on the one hand, I have acquired a general idea of the current challenges scientists
  are facing. On the other hand, having an avid interest in coding and hands-on stuff, I've got an up-to-date knowledge of
  current technologies used in the field of machine learning, including a couple of frameworks and libraries as
  well as some of the well-known optimization and high-performance computing techniques.<br>
  <br>
#  ### Technical skills<br>
#
#  Will be uploaded soon<br>
#
#  I'm a bit pressed for time at the moment, however, I will upload more information later on. If you think you'll come
#  here once in a blue moon and I can help you out in someway, then you can drop me an email or check out my
#  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/soran-ghaderi/">Linkedin</a>.

#  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

#  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
