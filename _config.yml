  Looking for a well-suited deep learning research position, I am currently intending to both join a vibrant research team and build on my academic foundations in Deep learning both theoretically and practically and stay in tune with new innovative researches through continued coursework and professional development.

  Besides, I have done a few pieces of research in <mark>Bioinformatic</mark> and <mark>Recommender systems</mark> as well as having team-working experience in software companies.

  My long-term goal is to figure out how the cognitive mechanisms give rise to intelligence. However, I do have more specific interests in the field, and the following are some of them:<br>
    - <mark>Attention mechanisms</mark><br>
    - <mark>Representation learning</mark><br>
    - <mark>Propabilistic graphical models</mark><br>
    - <mark>Generative models</mark><br>
  and a few more. To make it more tangible, I would like to employ the mentioned topics in:<br>
    - <mark>Machine vision</mark><br>
    - <mark>NLP and sequence models</mark> (e.g. speech recognition, machine translation, natural language understanding etc.)<br>
    - <mark>Question answering</mark><br>
    - <mark>Context extraction</mark><br>
    - <mark>Text generation</mark><br>
  and the list goes on.


#  You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else markdown supports such as
#    - Lists
#    - Tables
#    - <a href="google.com">Links</a>
#    - Images

# Projects Section
# projects_title: Projects #(Use this to override about projects section title)

# Experience Section
# experience_title: Experience #(Use this to override about experience section title)

# Education Section
# education_title: Education #(Use this to override about education section title)

# More Section
# more_title: A Little More About Me #(Use this to override about more section title)
more_content: | # this will include new lines to allow paragraphs

  I'm a bit pressed for time at the moment, however, I will upload more information (i.e. my research and work experiences) later on.
    If you think you'll come here once in a blue moon and I can help you out in someway, then you can check out my <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/soran-ghadri/">Linkedin</a>.

#  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

#  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
