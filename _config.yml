  I am a Master's student pursuing a specialization in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Essex. 
  With over three years of hands-on experience, my passion lies in the realm of deep learning and autonomous agents. 
  
  I am eager to explore the potential of attention mechanisms in enhancing the performance of multimodal models in 
  representation learning, reasoning, and zero-shot learning within uncertain environments.
  
  Parallel to this, I have actively engaged in freelance work and collaborated with research teams, and have made 
  contributions to the open-source community.
  
  
  My ultimate objective is to study the cognitive mechanisms underlying intelligence. Specifically, 
    - <mark>attention mechanisms</mark><br>
    - <mark>representation learning</mark><br>
  with a bias toward <mark>efficient computation</mark> in the following settings:
    - <mark>generative models</mark><br>
    - <mark>multimodal learning</mark><br>
    - <mark>self-supervised learning</mark><br>
  
  I aim to apply these concepts to 
    - <mark>machine vision</mark><br>
    - <mark>natural language processing (NLP)</mark><br>
      - <mark>machine translation</mark><br>
      - <mark>natural language understanding</mark><br>
      - <mark>question answering</mark><br>
      - <mark>context extraction</mark><br>
      - <mark>text generation</mark><br>
    - <mark>speech processing</mark><br>
    - <mark>video processing</mark><br>
      - <mark>generation</mark><br>
      - <mark>representation</mark><br>
    

#  ### Academic accomplishments<br>
#
#
#
#
#   - <a href="https://github.com/soran-ghaderi/NUSCCF">"<b>A new efficient subspace and K-Means-clustering based method to
#  improve Collaborative Filtering</b>"</a> was my B.Eng. final thesis, that tries to deal with the <b>High dimensionality</b> and
#  <b>data sparsity</b> problems in an <b>efficient</b> way which recommender systems are facing. <br>
#
#   - Another evident research accomplishment was in bioinformatics, that aimed to <b>predict</b> new correlations between
#  probiotics and diseases, which resulted in finding several new potential connections between the two.<br>
#
#   - Furthermore, I've written a new <b>Python library</b> for researchers working on <b>link prediction</b> in
#  <b>bipartite graphs</b> named <a href="https://github.com/bi-graph/bigraph"><b>BiGraph</b></a>. Fortunately, the repository on
#  Github has new contributors and is being updated once in a while. There's also the
#  <a href="https://bigraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html"><b>documentation</b></a> available for the package.
#  <br>
#
#  - Emgraph is a Python library — that I have worked on as a <b>ML engineer</b> — that tries to bring researchers involved in
#  <b>graph representation learning</b> up to speed.

#    - Lists
#    - Tables

  I'm Soran Ghaderi holding a BEng. in computer software engineering since 2018. My academic passions encompass the
  cutting-edge research conducted in the fields of machine learning; particularly, methods that are
  trying to understand and represent the surrounding world optimally.<br>

  During my B.Eng., recommendation systems, and bioinformatics were what I was interested in, along which I engrossed in
  machine learning and deep learning fields. Those were the impetuses to delve more deeply into the theories.
  Following the outstanding papers and research published by the internationally renowned research-labs and
  tech-companies for the last few years, on the one hand, I have acquired a general idea of the current challenges scientists
  are facing. On the other hand, having an avid interest in coding and hands-on stuff, I've got an up-to-date knowledge of
  current technologies used in the field of machine learning, including a couple of frameworks and libraries as
  well as some of the well-known optimization and high-performance computing techniques.<br>
  <br>
#  ### Technical skills<br>
#
#  Will be uploaded soon<br>
#
#  I'm a bit pressed for time at the moment, however, I will upload more information later on. If you think you'll come
#  here once in a blue moon and I can help you out in someway, then you can drop me an email or check out my
#  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/soran-ghaderi/">Linkedin</a>.

#  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

#  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
