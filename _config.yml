  Looking for a well-suited deep learning research position, I am currently intending to both join a vibrant research team and build on my academic foundations in Deep learning both theoretically and practically and stay in tune with new innovative researches through continued coursework and professional development.

  Besides, I have done a few pieces of research in <mark>Bioinformatic</mark> and <mark>Recommender systems</mark> as well as having team-working experience in software companies.

  My long-term goal is to figure out how the cognitive mechanisms give rise to intelligence. However, I do have more specific interests in the field, and the following are some of them:<br>
    - <mark>Attention mechanisms</mark><br>
    - <mark>Representation learning</mark><br>
    - <mark>Propabilistic graphical models</mark><br>
    - <mark>Generative models</mark><br>
  and a few more. To make it more tangible, I would like to employ the mentioned topics in:<br>
    - <mark>Machine vision</mark><br>
    - <mark>NLP and sequence models</mark> (e.g. speech recognition, machine translation, natural language understanding etc.)<br>
    - <mark>Question answering</mark><br>
    - <mark>Context extraction</mark><br>
    - <mark>Text generation</mark><br>
  and the list goes on.

  I'm Soran Ghaderi holding a BEng. in computer software engineeing since 2018. My academic passions encompass the 
  cutting-edge researches currently being conducted in the fields of machine learning; peculiarly, methods which are 
  trying to understand and represent the surrounding world optimaly.<br>
  
  Following the outstanding papers and researches being published by the internationally renowned research-labs and 
  tech-companies for the last few years on one hand, I have aquired a general idea of the current challenges scientists 
  are facing. On the other hand, having a keen interest in coding and hands-on stuff, I've an up-to-date knowledge of 
  current technologies being used the the field of machine learning including frameworks and libraries as well as some 
  of the well-known optimization and high performance computing techniques.<br>
  <br>
  
  #### my academic accomplishments<br>
  
  During my B.Eng., recommendation systems and bioinformatics were what I was interested in; along which I engrossed in 
  the machine learning and deep learning feilds. Those were the impetueses to delve more deeply into the theories as 
  well as enhancing my programming skills in particular python programming language and a couple of well-known and/or 
  cutting edge technologies in the field. <br>
  
  <a href="https://github.com/soran-ghaderi/NUSCCF">"A new efficient subspace and K-Means clustering based method to 
  improve Collaborative Filtering"</a> was my B.Eng. final thesis, which tries to deal with the High dimensionality and 
  data sparsity problems in an efficient way which recommender systems are facing. <br>
  
  Another noticeable research accomplishment was in bioinformatics which was aiming to predict new correlations between 
  probiotics and diseases and we could reveal a remarkable number of new potential connections between the two. <br> 
  
  Furthermore, I've written a whole new <mark>Python library</mark> for researchers who work on link prediction in 
  bipartite graphs named <a href="https://github.com/bi-graph/bigraph">BiGraph</a>. Furtunately, the repository on 
  Github has new contributors and is being updated once in a while. There's also the 
  <a href="https://bigraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html">documentation</a> available for the package. 
  <br> <br>
  
  
  I'm a bit pressed for time at the moment, however, I will upload more information later on. If you think you'll come 
  here once in a blue moon and I can help you out in someway, then you can drop me an email or check out my

#  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

#  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
