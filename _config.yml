  <b>Looking for</b> a well-suited <b>deep learning research position</b>, I am currently intending to both <b>join a vibrant research 
  team</b> and build on my academic foundations in Deep learning both theoretically and practically and stay in tune with 
  new innovative researches through continued coursework and professional development.
  
  Technically speaking, I have several years of <b>experience</b> in developing cutting-edge <b>ML</b> models and implementing <b>research papers</b> 
  using well-known frameworks and libraries, such as <b>Tensorflow</b> and <b>Pytorch</b>, to name a few, in my resume.
  Besides, I have done a few pieces of research in Bioinformatic and Recommender systems as well as having team-working 
  experience in software companies.
  
  
  My long-term goal is to figure out how the cognitive mechanisms give rise to intelligence. However, I do have more 
  specific interests in the field, and the following are some of them:<br>
    - <mark>Attention mechanisms</mark><br>
    - <mark>Representation learning</mark><br>
    - <mark>Propabilistic graphical models</mark><br>
    - <mark>Generative models</mark><br>
  and a few more. To make it more tangible, I would like to employ the mentioned topics in:<br>
    - <mark>Machine vision</mark><br>
    - <mark>NLP and sequence models</mark> (e.g. speech recognition, machine translation, natural language understanding etc.)<br>
    - <mark>Question answering</mark><br>
    - <mark>Context extraction</mark><br>
    - <mark>Text generation</mark><br>

#  You can even add paragraphs by using empty lines like this and add anything else markdown supports such as
#    - Lists
#    - Tables
#    - <a href="google.com">Links</a>
#    - Images

  I'm Soran Ghaderi holding a BEng. in computer software engineering since 2018. My academic passions encompass the 
  cutting-edge research conducted in the fields of machine learning; peculiarly, methods that are 
  trying to understand and represent the surrounding world optimally.<br>
    
  During my B.Eng., recommendation systems, and bioinformatics were what I was interested in, along which I engrossed in 
  machine learning and deep learning fields. Those were the impetuses to delve more deeply into the theories.
  Following the outstanding papers and research published by the internationally renowned research-labs and 
  tech-companies for the last few years, on the one hand, I have acquired a general idea of the current challenges scientists 
  are facing. On the other hand, having an avid interest in coding and hands-on stuff, I've got an up-to-date knowledge of 
  current technologies used in the field of machine learning, including a couple of frameworks and libraries as 
  well as some of the well-known optimization and high-performance computing techniques.<br>
  <br>
  

  ### <b>Soran Ghaderi</b>'s academic accomplishments<br>
  
  
   - <a href="https://github.com/soran-ghaderi/NUSCCF">"<b>A new efficient subspace and K-Means-clustering based method to 
  improve Collaborative Filtering</b>"</a> was my B.Eng. final thesis, that tries to deal with the <b>High dimensionality</b> and 
  <b>data sparsity</b> problems in an <b>efficient</b> way which recommender systems are facing. <br>
  
   - Another evident research accomplishment was in bioinformatics, that aimed to <b>predict</b> new correlations between 
  probiotics and diseases, which resulted in finding several new potential connections between the two.<br> 
  
   - Furthermore, I've written a new <b>Python library</b> for researchers working on <b>link prediction</b> in 
  <b>bipartite graphs</b> named <a href="https://github.com/bi-graph/bigraph"><b>BiGraph</b></a>. Fortunately, the repository on 
  Github has new contributors and is being updated once in a while. There's also the 
  <a href="https://bigraph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/intro.html"><b>documentation</b></a> available for the package. 
  <br> 
  
  - Emgraph is a Python library — that I have worked on as a <b>ML engineer</b> — that tries to bring researchers involved in 
  <b>graph representation learning</b> up to speed.

  ### Technical skills<br>
  
  Will be uploaded soon<br>
  
  I'm a bit pressed for time at the moment, however, I will upload more information later on. If you think you'll come 
  here once in a blue moon and I can help you out in someway, then you can drop me an email or check out my 
  <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/soran-ghaderi/">Linkedin</a>.

#  This is where you can write a little more about yourself. You could title this section **Interests** and include some of your other interests.

#  Or you could title it **Skills** and write a bit more about things that make you more desirable, like *leadership* or *teamwork*
