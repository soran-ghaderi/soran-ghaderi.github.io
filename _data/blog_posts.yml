  date: "March 2025"
  categories: "Research, Tutorials"
  description: "Hamiltonian mechanics is a way to describe how physical systems, like planets or pendulums, move over time, focusing on energy rather than just forces. By reframing complex dynamics through energy lenses, this 19th-century physics framework now powers cutting-edge generative AI."
