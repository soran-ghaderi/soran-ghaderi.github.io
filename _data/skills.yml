        I am generally interested in mathematics. However, I'm particularly interested in 
        fields such as geometry, algebra, and topology among others which I'm currently spending more time on and 
        am learning about information geometry, manifold learning, and geometric deep learning. Usually I try to 
        implement them in code and you can find more on my GitHub.<br><br>
        
        I enjoy staying up-to-date on the latest developments in fields relevant to my research interests, and usually try to read outstanding papers.<br><br>
        
        Apart from the above mentioned, I usually listen to the physics conferences/interviews on various topics as I find many of 
        the underlying theories highly relevant to theoretical ML.<br><br>
        
        In my free time, I enjoy strolling around the city or hiking. I also used to do Kickboxing for a many years.
