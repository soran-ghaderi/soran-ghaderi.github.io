    <p>I’m Soran Ghaderi holding a BEng. in computer software engineering since 2018. My academic passions encompass the cutting-edge research conducted in the fields of machine learning; particularly, methods that are trying to understand and represent the surrounding world optimally.

        During my B.Eng., recommendation systems, and bioinformatics were what I was interested in, along which I engrossed in machine learning and deep learning fields. Those were the impetuses to delve more deeply into the theories. Following the outstanding papers and research published by the internationally renowned research-labs and tech-companies for the last few years, on the one hand, I have acquired a general idea of the current challenges scientists are facing. On the other hand, having an avid interest in coding and hands-on stuff, I’ve got an up-to-date knowledge of current technologies used in the field of machine learning, including a couple of frameworks and libraries as well as some of the well-known optimization and high-performance computing techniques.</p>
