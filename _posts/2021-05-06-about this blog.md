## Foreword
Glad to introduce my personal blog. Possibly, I will share what I read daily about deep learning, robotics, neuroscience, mathematics etc.
  
## About me
I am holding a B.Eng. in computer eng. since 2018 and trying to learn new stuff in the mentioned areas whenever I have free time.
During the past few years I've been working on different projects both in the industry and opensource.<br>

<div>
Some libraries and applications I've been involved in are as follows:
<h4>Machine learning libraries</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>Emgraph</b>: A Python toolkit for knowledge graph embedding.
<p>It helps the researchers to develop, evaluate, and benchmark their works easily. Currently, there are already a number of models implemented and more will be introduced shortly.
At this time we're trying to optimize the underlying layers as well as simplifying the APIs even more.</p>
</li>
<li><b>Bigraph</b>: Bipartite-network link prediction in Python.</li>
</ul>

<h4>Applications</h4>
<ul>
<li><b>TASE: Telegram Audio Search Engine</b>: A lightning fast audio full-text search engine on top of Telegram</li>
</ul>
</div>
