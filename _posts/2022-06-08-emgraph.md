## About Emgraph
It provides a simple API for design, train, and evaluate graph embedding models. You can use the base models to easily develop your own model.

I designed the architecture and led the development of an opensource python library named Emgraph with TensorFlow 2 as its backend. It is used to develop, train, and evaluate Knowledge graph representation learning models.

It is worth mentioning that the Emgraph was initially a part of the Bigraph, that later we decided to seperate it from the parent library to keep the API more structured.
