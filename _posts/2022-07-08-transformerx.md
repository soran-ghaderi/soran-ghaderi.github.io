## Foreword
<b><a href="https://github.com/tensorops/TransformerX">TransformerX</a></b> is a Python library for building transformer-based models.

[//]: # (Glad to introduce my personal blog. Possibly, I will share what I read daily about deep learning, robotics, neuroscience, mathematics etc.)
  
## About TransformerX
It provides researchers, students, and professionals with building blocks needed in developing, training, and evaluating transformers and integrates smoothly into Tensorflow (we will add support for Pytorch, and JAX soon). We are actively working on adding more awesome features.

## Installation
<pre>$ pip install transformerx</pre>

[//]: # (During the past few years I've been working on different projects both in the industry and opensource.<br>)

[//]: # (<p>It helps the researchers to develop, evaluate, and benchmark their works easily. Currently, there are already a number of models implemented and more will be introduced shortly.)

[//]: # (At this time we're trying to optimize the underlying layers as well as simplifying the APIs even more.</p>)
