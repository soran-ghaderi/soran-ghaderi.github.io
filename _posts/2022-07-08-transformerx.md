## Abstract
TransformerX is an open-source Python library that provides a user-friendly interface to facilitate the construction 
of transformer-based models. It is aimed at researchers, students, and professionals seeking to develop, train, and 
evaluate transformers with ease. The library supports a range of transformer models, including the original 
Transformer among others. The development team is 
committed to continually enhancing the library's functionality, regularly adding new features and improvements to 
meet the needs of the research community. TransformerX seamlessly integrates with Tensorflow and will soon offer 
support for Pytorch and JAX. The library's documentation is extensive, featuring tutorials, examples, and technical 
details to assist users in understanding and effectively utilizing its capabilities.
